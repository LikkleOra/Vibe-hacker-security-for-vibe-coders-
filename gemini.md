## Gemini Added Memories
- Always update the gemini.md file after every change or completed task to ensure it always reflects the latest project status. This is a hard rule.

## Project Status

- Added navigation buttons to the header to improve user experience.
- Fixed all linting errors and warnings.
- Removed the duplicate `package-lock.json` file to resolve conflicts.
- The application is now in a more stable and user-friendly state.

## Issue Log

### Issue 1: Convex Server Not Starting

*   **Symptom:** `[CONVEX Q(scans:getScansForUser)] [Request ID: 2806fe666a9b4e82] Server Error: Could not find public function for 'scans:getScansForUser'.`
*   **Root Cause:** The `CLERK_ISSUER_URL` environment variable was missing in `vibesec/.env.local`, which is required for Convex authentication to initialize correctly.
*   **Solution:** Added the `CLERK_ISSUER_URL` to `vibesec/.env.local` and restarted the `convex dev` server.

### Issue 2: Webpack Module Error

*   **Symptom:** `__webpack_modules__[moduleId] is not a function` in the Next.js application.
*   **Root Cause:** Likely a corrupted Next.js build cache or dependency issue.
*   **Solution (Attempt 1):** Delete the `.next` directory and restart the Next.js development server.

### Issue 3: Application Crash After Sign-up

*   **Symptom:** The application crashes after the user signs up and is redirected to the dashboard.
*   **Root Cause:** The `ConvexProvider` was not correctly integrated with Clerk. The application was using the standard `ConvexProvider` instead of `ConvexProviderWithClerk`, which is necessary to make the Convex client aware of the authenticated user.
*   **Solution:** Updated `src/app/layout.tsx` to use `ConvexProviderWithClerk` and passed the `useAuth` hook from Clerk to it.

### Issue 4: Clerk JWT Template Missing

*   **Symptom:** "No JWT template exists with name: convex" error after sign-up.
*   **Root Cause:** Clerk was trying to use a JWT template named "convex" for secure communication with Convex, but this template was not configured in the Clerk dashboard.
*   **Solution:** The user manually created a JWT template named "convex" in the Clerk dashboard, providing the correct Convex Issuer URL (`https://incredible-dodo-967.convex.cloud`). The development servers were then restarted to pick up the changes.

### Issue 5: Failed to Authenticate (No Auth Provider Found)

*   **Symptom:** `Error: Failed to authenticate: "No auth provider found matching the given token (no providers configured). Check convex/auth.config.ts."`
*   **Root Cause:** Unresolved. The Convex server is unable to find an authentication provider configured to handle the authentication token it receives from Clerk, despite `convex/auth.config.js` appearing to be correctly configured and `CLERK_ISSUER_URL` being set.
*   **Solution:** Unresolved. To be investigated further.
