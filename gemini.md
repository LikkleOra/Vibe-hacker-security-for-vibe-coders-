- Activation: [x%] of new users complete [core action] within [y] days by [date].
- Retention: [x%] D30 retention for [persona].
- Core Web Vitals (p75): LCP < 2.5s, CLS < 0.1, INP < 200ms.
- Business: [KPI] increases by [x%] by [date].

#### Out of Scope (MVP)
- [Feature/area] is explicitly excluded from MVP.
- [Integration] deferred to Phase [n].

#### Assumptions and Constraints
- Assumes [dependency/service] availability.
- Budget/time constraints: [state].

Vibecker is a tool that will help vibe coders find and resolve security vulnerabilties

### Problem Statement
Developers need an easy way to identify and resolve security issues in their code.

#### Feature: [Feature Name] (e.g., User Authentication)
**User Story:** As a [user type], I want to [do something], so that I can [achieve a result].

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Given [precondition] When [user action] Then the system shall [observable outcome]
- And logs/metrics capture [telemetry event]

**Quality & Safety:**
- Response quality score ≥ [threshold] on golden set
- p95 latency ≤ [ms], error rate ≤ [x%]
- No PII leakage on red-team prompts (0 critical findings)
- Refuse unsafe requests per policy with [standard message/code]
- Hallucination rate ≤ [x%] on evaluation set

**Negative Cases:**
- Given invalid input, Then show [clear error]
- Given rate limit exceeded, Then return [429 + Retry-After]

**Stakeholders & RACI:** [Who is Responsible, Accountable, Consulted, Informed]

### Non-Functional Requirements
- PWA support
- Mobile responsiveness
- Offline functionality
- Cross-browser compatibility
- Security and privacy guidelines
- Accessibility: WCAG 2.2 AA, prefers-reduced-motion supported
- Observability: Tracing (W3C Trace Context), metrics, structured logs
- Compliance: GDPR/CCPA/DSAR handling, cookie consent, data residency
- Secrets management: Never in repo; use [e.g., Vault, AWS Secrets Manager]
- Data protection: TLS 1.2+, encryption at rest (e.g., AES-256), key rotation
- Availability: SLO [e.g., 99.9%], error budget policy
- Backup/DR: RPO [x], RTO [y], tested quarterly
- API: Versioning strategy (e.g., v1), rate limiting, idempotency for writes
- Internationalization: i18n/l10n strategy, time zones, RTL support if needed
- Privacy by design: Data minimization, purpose limitation, retention schedules

### Security, Privacy & Compliance
- Threat Model: STRIDE-style summary, attack surfaces, mitigations
- Data Handling: Prompt/response logging policy, PII classification, masking
- Legal/Compliance: GDPR/CCPA/HIPAA (as applicable), DPA, data residency
- Secrets & Access: KMS/Secrets Manager, rotation, least privilege (IAM)
- Network: TLS 1.2+, mTLS (if internal), WAF, IP allow/deny, CSP for web
- Guardrails: Content moderation, prompt injection defenses, tool-call allowlist
- Auditing: Tamper-evident logs, access audits, retention policy

#### Persona 2: [e.g., The Casual User]

### Performance Requirements
- p95 latency ≤ [x] ms, p99 ≤ [y] ms
- Throughput: [QPS]/[tokens/sec], concurrent sessions: [n]
- Cold start ≤ [x] ms (serverless) or warm pool size [n]
- Rate Limits: [requests/min], burst [x], quota [daily/monthly]
- Cost Budget: ≤ [$x] per 1k requests or per active user/month

## 🚀 Tasks & Implementation

> Organized by phase. Each task should map to a requirement and include Priority, Status, and Dependencies.
> Each task must include: Owner, Estimate, Definition of Done (DoD), linked Acceptance Criteria, and Rollout Plan (feature flag/experiment).

### Phase 1 – Project Setup
- **Task:** Set up repo with Next.js
- **Priority:** High
- **Status:** Done
- **Owner:** [Name]
- **Estimate:** [e.g., 2d]
- **Dependencies:** None
- **DoD:** CI with tests, linting, type checks; SBOM; Dev/Prod env parity; feature flag framework

### Phase 2 – Core Feature: Vulnerability Scanner
- **Task:** Set up Convex and Clerk for authentication and database
- **Priority:** High
- **Status:** Done
- **Dependencies:** None
- **Task:** Build vulnerability scanner component
- **Priority:** High
- **Status:** To Do
- **Dependencies:** Convex and Clerk setup

### Risk Management
[Identify potential risks (technical, operational, business) and outline mitigation strategies.]

### Rollout Plan
[Describe the strategy for deploying the feature/project, including phased rollouts, A/B testing, and rollback procedures.]

---

## 🧪 Testing Strategy

### Unit Tests
[Describe the approach to unit testing, including frameworks (e.g., Jest, Vitest) and target coverage.]
- Golden tests for prompt templates and tool-call orchestration
- Deterministic checks with fixed seeds/params for snapshot stability

### Integration Tests
[Describe the approach to integration testing, including how different parts of the system will be tested together.]
- E2E flows with mock Gemini + live smoke in staging
- Contract tests (OpenAPI/JSON schema) with providers and tools
- Load tests: tokens/sec, concurrent sessions, soak testing
- Chaos: inject timeouts, rate limits, provider failures; verify fallbacks
- Contract tests: Provider/consumer (e.g., Pact)
- API tests: Auth, rate limit, idempotency, pagination
- Data: Migration tests and rollback validation

### End-to-End (E2E) Tests
- Critical paths with [Playwright/Cypress]
- Cross-browser/device matrix

### User Acceptance Testing (UAT)
[Describe how UAT will be conducted, including who will be involved and what the process will be.]
- LLM Eval Harness: curated datasets (golden, adversarial, red team)
- Metrics: correctness, hallucination, toxicity, jailbreak resiliency
- CI Gates: block deploy if evals regress beyond thresholds
- Post-deploy canary + automated rollback criteria

### Security Testing
- SAST/Secrets scan in CI; DAST on preview/prod; dependency audit (SCA)
- Threat modeling checklist; authZ/authN tests

### Performance/Load Testing
- Load/soak/stress tests with [k6/Locust]; thresholds aligned to SLOs

### Accessibility Testing
- Automated a11y checks (axe) + manual keyboard/screen-reader passes

### Resilience/Chaos Testing
- Fault injection for downstream/timeouts; retry/backoff verification
