# VibeSec CI/CD Integration Plan

## Goal

Integrate VibeSec into the CI/CD pipeline to provide automated security feedback on every `git push`.

## Platform

We will use GitHub Actions, as the project is already set up with a `.github/workflows` directory.

## Steps

1.  **Create a new GitHub Actions workflow file:** ` .github/workflows/vibesec.yml`.

2.  **Trigger the workflow:** The workflow will trigger on `push` events to the `main` branch.

3.  **Checkout the code:** The workflow will use the `actions/checkout@v3` action to checkout the code.

4.  **Set up Python:** The workflow will use the `actions/setup-python@v3` action to set up a Python environment.

5.  **Install dependencies:** The workflow will install the necessary Python dependencies using `pip install -r requirements.txt`. We will need to create a `requirements.txt` file.

6.  **Run the VibeSec scan:** The workflow will run the `run_vibesec_scan.py` script.

7.  **Handle API Key:** The `GEMINI_API_KEY` will be stored as a secret in the GitHub repository settings and accessed in the workflow using `${{ secrets.GEMINI_API_KEY }}`.

8.  **Upload results:** The `final_coached_results.json` file will be uploaded as an artifact using the `actions/upload-artifact@v3` action.

## Future Enhancements

*   **Pull Request comments:** Post a summary of the scan results as a comment on the pull request.
*   **Status checks:** Use the scan results to create a status check on the pull request, which can be used to block merging if critical vulnerabilities are found.
